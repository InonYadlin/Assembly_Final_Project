Space Invaders Clone
Project Overview
  This project is a Space Invaders clone developed in assembly language. 
  The goal is to recreate the classic arcade game,  
  where players control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and must defend Earth by shooting down waves of invading aliens.

Features
  1. Player-controlled spaceship: Move left and right using arrow keys and shoot with the spacebar.
  2. Lives system: The player starts with 3 lives and loses one whenever hit by an enemy.

Technology Stack
  Assembly Language: The game is written in assembly, using low-level programming to handle graphics, input, and game logic.
  
Controls
  Left Arrow: Move the spaceship left.
  Right Arrow: Move the spaceship right.
  Spacebar: Shoot a bullet to destroy aliens.

Future Improvements
  1. Add sound effects and music.
  2. Implement power-ups and different enemy types.
  3. Add difficulty levels and more alien waves.
  4. Score tracking: Keep track of the player's score as they defeat enemies.
  5. Lives system: The player starts with 3 lives and loses one whenever hit by an enemy.
  6. Game over: The game ends when the player runs out of lives or the aliens reach the bottom of the screen.
